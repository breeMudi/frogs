This is a my first attempt at publishing a spline driven web interface

In this simple design, lazy loading was implemented to observe changes in page loading speed

the loading test is carried out using the website gtmetrix.com to examine the github pages version of this webpage.

This was done doing spline viewer

using (\_\_\_\_) the app performed poorly on the main main performance indices

Steps are needed to increase the state of the user experience on the app;

Step 1:

- save spline file in gltf format
- Load into a threejs scene in vanila javascript
- See if the metadata of the various polygons (e.g. frog eye pupils) can be called and manupulated using threejs and DOM commands
- The gltf file exported from spline does not contain a scene file attached to it. How do we create one?
- Ensure camera for the three js scene is at the middle
